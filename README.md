Problem Type: binary classification problem
Target Variable: made_shot (TRUE for made shots, FALSE for missed shots)
Model Objective: the model is expected to learn patterns from shot data—such as location, shot type, and game context—and predict whether a given shot attempt will be successful or not

Short Problem Description:
This project builds a binary classification model to predict shot outcomes in the WNBA. Using a dataset of 41,497 shots from the 2021–2022 season, the model will classify whether a shot is made or missed based on features like shot coordinates, shot type, and game situation. The results can help analyze shooting efficiency and team performance.
