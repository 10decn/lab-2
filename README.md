This project builds a binary classification model to predict shot outcomes in the WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association). Using a dataset of 41,497 shots from the 2021–2022 season, the model will classify whether a shot is made or missed based on features like shot coordinates, shot type, and game situation. The results can help analyze shooting efficiency and team performance.
